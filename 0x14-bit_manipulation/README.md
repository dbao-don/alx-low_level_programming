# 0x14-bit_manipulation
This secion contains a collection of programs written in C that demonstrate various bit manipulation techniques. These programs serve as a useful reference for understanding how bitwise operations can be used to manipulate binary data.
## Tasks
| Task | Description |
|:--|:--|
| 0-binary_to_uint.c | a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int |
| 1-print_binary.c | a function that prints the binary representation of a number. |
| 2-get_bit.c | a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. |
| 3-set_bit.c | a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. | 4-clear_bit.c | a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. |
| 5-flip_bits.c | a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. |
